## üîç How It Works

### 1. File System Monitoring
- Uses Python's `watchdog` library for real-time file system events
- Monitors specified directories for file modifications, creations, and deletions
- Tracks file access patterns and modification rates

### 2. Threat Detection
The system detects potential ransomware through multiple indicators:
- **Rapid File Modifications**: Multiple files modified in short time window
- **Suspicious Extensions**: Files renamed with known ransomware extensions
- **File Size Changes**: Significant changes in file sizes (encryption indicators)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Behavioral patterns typical of ransomware

### 3. Automated Response
When threats are detected:
- **Immediate Backup**: Creates emergency backups of affected files
- **Threat Assessment**: Calculates threat score based on multiple factors
- **Automated Recovery**: Restores files if threat score exceeds threshold
- **Logging & Alerts**: Records all activities and sends notifications

### 4. Recovery System
- **Backup Management**: Maintains versioned backups with configurable retention
- **Integrity Verification**: Verifies backup and restored file integrity
- **Multiple Recovery Options**: Automatic and manual recovery modes
- **Rollback Capability**: Can restore from different backup versions

## üìä System Monitoring

### Real-time Status Display
When running `python main.py start`, the system shows:
- Current monitoring status
- Detection statistics
- Response activities
- System health indicators

### Log Files
The system generates detailed logs in the `logs/` directory:
- `ransomware_detection.log`: Main system log
- Rotating logs with timestamps
- Different log levels for debugging and monitoring

### Statistics and Reporting
Access system statistics through:
```bash
python main.py status  # Current system status and statistics
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Detection Capabilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Immediate detection of suspicious activities
- **Pattern-based Detection**: Recognizes common ransomware behaviors
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable sensitivity for different environments

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Automated Backups**: Continuous backup of monitored files
- **Rapid Response**: Quick reaction to detected threats
- **File Recovery**: Automatic restoration from clean backups
- **System Isolation**: Can isolate affected files during attacks

## üîß Development & Customization

### Adding New Detection Rules
Extend the `ThreatDetector` class in `src/threat_detector.py`:
```python
def custom_detection_rule(self, file_events):
    # Implement custom detection logic
    pass
```

### Custom Response Actions
Modify the `AutomatedResponseSystem` class in `src/automated_response.py`:
```python
def custom_response_action(self, threat_info):
    # Implement custom response logic
    pass
```

### Configuration Extensions
Add new configuration options in `config.json` and update `ConfigManager`.
