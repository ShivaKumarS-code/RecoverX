# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves developing a Python-based ransomware detection and automated recovery tool designed to monitor file systems in real-time for suspicious activities indicative of ransomware attacks. The system will automatically detect potential threats through pattern recognition of rapid file changes and encryption activities, then trigger automated restoration from versioned backups to minimize data loss. The tool is designed for educational purposes as a final year CSE project while demonstrating enterprise-level security concepts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to continuously monitor my file system for suspicious activities, so that I can detect potential ransomware attacks in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL monitor specified directories for file system events
2. WHEN files are modified at a rate exceeding normal thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag this as suspicious activity
3. WHEN file extensions are changed to unknown or encrypted formats THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert
4. WHEN multiple files are accessed/modified simultaneously THEN the system SHALL evaluate this pattern for ransomware behavior
5. IF monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL log all file system events with timestamps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backup creation and versioning, so that I have clean copies of files available for recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create initial backups of all monitored files
2. WHEN files are modified under normal conditions THEN the system SHALL create versioned backups automatically
3. WHEN backup operations occur THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity using hash verification
4. IF backup storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement rotation policies for older versions
5. WHEN backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt retry operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic file restoration when ransomware is detected, so that data loss is minimized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ransomware activity is confirmed THEN the system SHALL immediately stop monitoring the affected files
2. WHEN restoration is triggered THEN the system SHALL restore files from the most recent clean backup version
3. WHEN restoration occurs THEN the system SHALL verify restored file integrity using stored hashes
4. IF restoration fails for any file THEN the system SHALL attempt restoration from previous backup versions
5. WHEN restoration completes THEN the system SHALL log all restoration activities and success rates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and alerting capabilities, so that I can track system activities and receive notifications of security events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system event occurs THEN it SHALL be logged with timestamp, event type, and relevant details
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate email alerts to configured recipients
3. WHEN restoration activities complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports of actions taken
4. IF email alerts fail to send THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt alternative notification methods
5. WHEN log files reach size limits THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple interface to configure and monitor the tool, so that I can easily manage the system without complex command-line operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL provide either a CLI or GUI interface for configuration
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings before applying them
3. WHEN the interface is accessed THEN it SHALL display current monitoring status and recent activity
4. IF GUI is implemented THEN it SHALL show real-time statistics of monitored files and detected events
5. WHEN users request system status THEN the interface SHALL provide clear information about active monitoring and backup status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want file integrity verification capabilities, so that I can ensure backups and restored files are not corrupted or tampered with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are backed up THEN the system SHALL generate and store cryptographic hashes for each file
2. WHEN file integrity checks are performed THEN the system SHALL compare current file hashes with stored baseline hashes
3. WHEN hash mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential file corruption or tampering
4. IF integrity verification fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to locate alternative clean backup versions
5. WHEN restoration occurs THEN the system SHALL verify restored file integrity before marking restoration as successful
